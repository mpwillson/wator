# wator

A Clojurescript implementation of the Wator simulation, as described
in The Armchair Universe, by A. K. Dwedney.

## Installation

Download from [Github](http://github.com/mpwillson/wator).  You'll need
everthing under the resources directory, which you should copy to an
appropriate location (or web server) and change as required by the
environment.

## Usage

More information on Wator can be found
on[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor). A. K. Dwedney's
original paper seems to have disappeared.

The only real difference between this version and the original is that
fish and sharks can move/hunt diagonally as well as orthogonally.

Try it at [hydrus](http://hydrus.org.uk/wator.html).

### Bugs

Probably many and various.
